All the data contained here should be considered "draft" quality. It's basically
correct but there are still a bunch of details that need to be accounted
for. There are also some known-knowns that have not been addressed. It should be
enough to get you started though.

As of this writing all the data is using the Spherical Mercator (EPSG:900913)
projection because there is some bad-ness happening when I convert them back to
the more common WGS84 and I just haven't had time to figure out what's going
on. Good times.
